# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

This repo contains all my work for the deeplearning.ia specialization by Andrew Ng on coursera. All the code base, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified, [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

## About Me

In am skilled in programming and statistical modeling. I am passionate about building big data architeatures, applying machine learning models, programming data products and creating visualizations to solve business problems. And now I am in the path for learning Deep Learning and AI. In This reposirotry I share **my solutions** which are **only for reference purpose**. And its not allowed to copy any part of the code or to copy the quiz solutions.

Currently, this repo has 2 major parts you may be interested in and I will give a list here.
